 # Part one:

## Art pieces and their depiction**

 Among scrolling through the numerous prints found in the [Harvard Art Muesuem website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), I was intrigued by the number of art pieces taken from many regions of the world. My favorite was the  [Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina](https://hvrd.art/o/70419). According to the metadata from the website, this is an Italian painting by Giovanni Battista Piranesi dating back to the 18th century, reflecting the antiques of the Roman Empire. The print's beauty and the symbolism of its elements are astonishing. It incorporates numerous elements, each symbolizing different aspects, and showing the reconstruction of Rome, blending elements of engineering, architecture, and history. . The term "Via Appia" translates to "Queen of Roads," symbolizing, in my view, the intersection between the past and present, and the transition that the Roman Empire had gone through. The author seems to comment on the transition from the empire's glory to ruins while also including the ever-remaining remnants of this empire.
 

 Another one is ["Nocturne: Furnace"]( https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/303703?position=303703), by Mrs.Walter Yates from 1879-1880,  which employs the etching technique. This art piece conveys the contrast between light and darkness.The artwork may represent the encroachment of industrialization upon the serene flow of nature or depict the unyielding advancement of modernity as it stands out against the calm of the nocturnal setting. Again, the Harvard Art Musuem did not provide any content description, but the information about the technique of etching provides some insight into the idea of nightime and darkness.


I also wanted to mention the [1919.169:Â Manuscript of the Qur'an](https://hvrd.art/o/216447). According to the website, the manuscript is from the Ottoman period from the 16th century. What I liked about it is how it reflects Islamic Calligraphy and Art, featuring ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper. Its meaning reflects the rich presrvation and continuity. This print has such historical and religious significance and part of the Ottoman cultural Heritage. 


## Information Access
The website lacked a description of the print's symbolism or content description, which I found to be a missing piece of valuable information. However, I found the website easy to use, and you can also get permanent links to the artwork, in addition to being able to download them. The website also provided valuable information, such as the accession year, recorded ownership history, techniques used, date or origin, etc.  However, with the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), I was able to get a more clear description, and the layout of the objects were filtered based on the year and origin, which made it easier to track. It also had the objects sorted out by the cultures, with the objects of each culture put together, which I found to be more convenient. 




# Part two:
Looking at the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), I can see that the musuem contains a wide range of artworks from various cultures, old and contemporary.Using the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), we can see that, according to the two spreadsheets, the most viewed artworks are American, British, German, Italian and French. There was a good number of Japanese and Chinese pieces, but not a lot of Middle Eastern pieces were found.
