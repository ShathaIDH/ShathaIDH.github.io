 # Part one

## Artworks and their depiction:

![*Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina*](print1.jpg)
 
 Among scrolling through the numerous prints found in the [Harvard Art Muesuem website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), I was intrigued by the number of art pieces taken from many regions of the world. My favorite was the  [Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina](https://hvrd.art/o/70419). According to the metadata from the website, this is an Italian painting by Giovanni Battista Piranesi dating back to the 18th century, reflecting the antiques of the Roman Empire. The print's beauty and the symbolism of its elements are astonishing. It incorporates numerous elements, each symbolizing different aspects, and showing the reconstruction of Rome, blending elements of engineering, architecture, and history. . The term "Via Appia" translates to "Queen of Roads," symbolizing, in my view, the intersection between the past and present, and the transition that the Roman Empire had gone through. The author seems to comment on the transition from the empire's glory to ruins while also including the ever-remaining remnants of this empire.
 

 Another one is ["Nocturne: Furnace"]( https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/303703?position=303703), by Mrs.Walter Yates from 1879-1880,  which employs the etching technique. This art piece conveys the contrast between light and darkness.The artwork may represent the encroachment of industrialization upon the serene flow of nature or depict the unyielding advancement of modernity as it stands out against the calm of the nocturnal setting. Again, the Harvard Art Musuem did not provide any content description, but the information about the technique of etching provides some insight into the idea of nightime and darkness.


I also wanted to mention the [1919.169:Â Manuscript of the Qur'an](https://hvrd.art/o/216447). According to the website, the manuscript is from the Ottoman period from the 16th century. What I liked about it is how it reflects Islamic Calligraphy and Art, featuring ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper. Its meaning reflects the rich presrvation and continuity. This print has such historical and religious significance and part of the Ottoman cultural Heritage. 


## Information Access
The website lacked a description of the print's symbolism or content description, which I found to be a missing piece of valuable information. However, I found the website easy to use, and you can also get permanent links to the artwork, in addition to being able to download them. The website also provided valuable information, such as the accession year, recorded ownership history, techniques used, date or origin, etc.  However, with the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), I was able to get a more clear description, and the layout of the objects were filtered based on the year and origin, which made it easier to track. It also had the objects sorted out by the cultures, with the objects of each culture put together, which I found to be more convenient. 




# Part two: most and least viewed
Looking at the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), I can see that the musuem contains a wide range of artworks from various cultures, old and contemporary.Using the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), we can see that, according to the two spreadsheets, the most viewed artworks are American, British, German, Italian and French. There was a good number of Japanese and Chinese pieces, but not a lot of Central Asian, Middle Eastern or African pieces.

From the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), The most viewed objects are American, with 90,115 views. Next comes German with 35,600, followed by French objects with 26,040, and then British with 11,114. As you can see, most of these cultures are the dominant ones, and when we look at the historical context, we would understand that it links back to the periods of imperialism, where these cultures became prominent. 

The most viewed object in the Harvard Art Musuem is the American object [1943.150: The Breakfast Table](https://hvrd.art/o/299794) by John Singer Sargent 1883-1884. According to the gallery text, John Singer Sargent depicts his sister Violet in a luxurious setting, emphasizing both her character and their opulent surroundings in France, 1883. This piece, influenced by French Impressionism, showcases Sargent's skillful use of light, color, and composition, paying tribute to the likes of Degas and Manet, as well as his friend, artist Albert Besnard.


### Most and Least viewed in the Armenian culture: 

For my choice of the Armenian culture, the most viewed object is the [1927.271: Embroidered chalice veil](https://hvrd.art/o/215237)(167 views), an emroided textile from the 19th century during the Ottoman period. The embroidery features yellow, green, blue, and silver threads, showcasing a lamb with a cross or column inside a sunburst circle, flanked by twelve angels. The least viewed object in the Armenian culture is the [One Tram](https://ai.harvardartmuseums.org/object/181399) 1198-1219. The reason I think Armenian objects are the least viewed might be bacause the objects are not featured prominently on the website, such as on the Homepage or in special exhibitions. Considering the vast amount of objects that the musuem holds, it is definitely very hard to find Armenian objects that will appear on your search.
