 ###Part one:

![*Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina*](print1.jpg)
 
 Among scrolling through the numerous prints found in the [Harvard Art Muesuem website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), I was intrigued by the number of art pieces taken from many regions of the world. My favorite was the  [Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina](https://hvrd.art/o/70419). According to the metadata from the website, this is an Italian painting by Giovanni Battista Piranesi dating back to the 18th century, reflecting the antiques of the Roman Empire. The print's beauty and the symbolism of its elements are astonishing. It incorporates numerous elements, each symbolizing different aspects, and showing the reconstruction of Rome, blending elements of engineering, architecture, and history. . The term "Via Appia" translates to "Queen of Roads," symbolizing, in my view, the intersection between the past and present, and the transition that the Roman Empire had gone through. The author seems to comment on the transition from the empire's glory to ruins while also including the ever-remaining remnants of this empire.
 

 Other artworks that caught my attention included ["Nocturne: Furnace"]( and "M2783: Interior," both employing the etching technique, Both of these artworks, based on what was said on the website used the technique of etching, which I really find so interesting. I feel like it adds that realistic feeling to the pieces. I tend to search for artworks that hold deep meanings, those who sound The Nocture:Furnace  shows the contrast between light and dark, and how light can find its way through darkness and the second one depics what goes on in the interior of people's lives.. But overall, I found it a bit hard to search for artworks in the [HAM](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections) website just because there were a lot of art pieces and they was no filter.




 The website lacked a description of the painting's symbolism, which I found to be a missing piece of valuable information. However, I found the website easy to use, and you can also get permanent links to the artwork, in addition to being able to download them. The website also provided information like the accession year, recorded ownership history,etc. In other words, it was pretty accessible. However, with the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), I was able to get a more clear description, and the layout of the objects were filtered based on the year and origin, which made it easier to track. I found the data spreadsheet more convenient to use.






**Part two**: Looking at the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), I can see that the musuem contains a wide range of artworks from various cultures, old and contemporary.Using the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), we can see that, according to the two spreadsheets, the most viewed artworks are American, British, German, Italian and French. There was a good number of Japanese and Chinese pieces, but not a lot of Middle Eastern pieces were found.
