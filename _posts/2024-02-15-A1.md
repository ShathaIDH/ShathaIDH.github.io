# Part one: 


## Artworks and their depiction:

![*Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina*](print1.jpg)

 ![print1](https://github.com/ShathaIDH/ShathaIDH.github.io/assets/158850618/c113edc4-2b85-4f7b-9e34-f2e430c8f974)

 Among scrolling through the numerous prints found in the [Harvard Art Muesuem website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), I was intrigued by the number of art pieces taken from many regions of the world. My favorite was the  [Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina](https://hvrd.art/o/70419). According to the metadata from the website, this is an Italian painting by Giovanni Battista Piranesi dating back to the 18th century, reflecting the antiques of the Roman Empire. The print's beauty and the symbolism of its elements are astonishing. It incorporates numerous elements, each symbolizing different aspects, and showing the reconstruction of Rome, blending elements of engineering, architecture, and history. . The term "Via Appia" translates to "Queen of Roads," symbolizing, in my view, the intersection between the past and present, and the transition that the Roman Empire had gone through. The author seems to comment on the transition from the empire's glory to ruins while also including the ever-remaining remnants of this empire.
 

 Another one is ["Nocturne: Furnace"]( https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/303703?position=303703), by Mrs.Walter Yates from 1879-1880,  which employs the etching technique. This art piece conveys the contrast between light and darkness.The artwork may represent the encroachment of industrialization upon the serene flow of nature or depict the unyielding advancement of modernity as it stands out against the calm of the nocturnal setting. Again, the Harvard Art Musuem did not provide any content description, but the information about the technique of etching provides some insight into the idea of nightime and darkness.


I also wanted to mention the [1919.169:Â Manuscript of the Qur'an](https://hvrd.art/o/216447). According to the website, the manuscript is from the Ottoman period from the 16th century. What I liked about it is how it reflects Islamic Calligraphy and Art, featuring ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper. Its meaning reflects the rich presrvation and continuity. This print has such historical and religious significance and part of the Ottoman cultural Heritage. 


## Information Access
The website lacked  description of the prints' symbolism or content description, which I found to be a missing piece of valuable information. However, I found the website easy to use, and you can also get permanent links to the artwork, in addition to being able to download them. The website also provided valuable information, such as the accession year, recorded ownership history, techniques used, date or origin, etc.  However, with the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), I was able to get a more clear description, and the layout of the objects were filtered based on the year and origin, which made it easier to track. It also had the objects sorted out by the cultures, with the objects of each culture put together, which I found to be more convenient. 




# Part two: most and least viewed
Looking at the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), I can see that the musuem contains a wide range of artworks from various cultures, old and contemporary.Using the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), we can see that, according to the two spreadsheets, the most viewed artworks are American, British, German, Italian and French. There was a good number of Japanese and Chinese pieces, but not a lot of Central Asian, Middle Eastern or African pieces.

From the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), The most viewed objects are American, with 90,115 views. Next comes German with 35,600, followed by French objects with 26,040, and then British with 11,114. As you can see, most of these cultures are the dominant ones, and when we look at the historical context, we would understand that it links back to the periods of imperialism, where these cultures became prominent. 

The most viewed object in the Harvard Art Musuem is the American object [1943.150: The Breakfast Table](https://hvrd.art/o/299794) by John Singer Sargent 1883-1884. According to the gallery text, John Singer Sargent depicts his sister Violet in a luxurious setting, emphasizing both her character and their opulent surroundings in France, 1883. This piece, influenced by French Impressionism, showcases Sargent's skillful use of light, color, and composition, paying tribute to the likes of Degas and Manet, as well as his friend, artist Albert Besnard.


### Most and Least viewed in the Armenian culture: 

For my choice of the Armenian culture, the most viewed object is the [1927.271: Embroidered chalice veil](https://hvrd.art/o/215237)(167 views), an embroided textile from the 19th century from the Ottoman period. The embroidery features yellow, green, blue, and silver threads, showcasing a lamb with a cross inside a sunburst circle, bounded by twelve angels. The least viewed object in the Armenian culture is the [One Tram](https://ai.harvardartmuseums.org/object/181399) 1198-1219. The reason I think Armenian objects are of the least viewed might be bacause the objects are not featured prominently on the website, such as on the Homepage or in special exhibitions. Considering the vast amount of objects that the musuem holds, it is definitely very hard to find Armenian objects that will appear on your search.  




# Part Three: Word Clouds

For this part, I've chosen three cultures to build word clouds for: Byzantine, Egyptian, and Japanese. I've selected the Byzantine and Egyptian cultures because they share similarities with my own, offering a sense of connection and familiarity. Particularly, Egyptian artifacts carry a profound historical and cultural significance that resonates throughout the Arab region. Similarly, the Byzantine culture, with its rich  history, religion, and art, has influenced many aspects of Eastern traditions and has been significant in shaping the cultural heritage of many parts around the Midterranean.

Japanese culture is different. It shows us another way of looking at the world. It has its own special ways, ideas, and art. The contrast of the elements in Japanese art is astonishing and it really has such a place in my heart( I love Japan ðŸ˜‚). Adding Japanese culture here shows us how wide and interesting the world's cultures are.


Word clouds give us what is important in each culture. They show us the big topics and what people focus on. When we look at the word clouds of the obect culture we see at the Harvard Art Museum, we see the stories they're sharing about these cultures. We also learn which parts of the cultures they think are worth showing.


For instance, if words like "gold," "iconography," and "mosaics" frequently appear in a Byzantine word cloud, it could indicate a focus on religious and imperial themes within the museum's Byzantine collection.

For Egyptian culture, prominent terms include "pyramid," "sphinx," "mummy," "hieroglyphics," "pharaoh," "Nile," and "Anubis." These words reflect the  Egyptian mythology, the pharaonic era, and iconic monuments that continue to have an influence on Egyptian culture. 

![egyptian](https://github.com/ShathaIDH/ShathaIDH.github.io/assets/158850618/25455b3a-0b0b-4e61-b95b-dc752b3c25d8)

The Japanese wordcloudhighlights words like "samurai," "sushi," "kimono," "sakura," "zen," "garden," "kabuki," "sumo," "Tokyo," "geisha," "Fuji," "tea ceremony," "anime," and "manga." These words define the traditional and modern elements of Japn, covering apsects of warriorship and also touching on their beautiful cuisine. The colors associated with this word cloud such as Red, Black, and White help reflect the features of Japanese culture. 

![japanese](https://github.com/ShathaIDH/ShathaIDH.github.io/assets/158850618/59ba0bc1-9168-41b9-8fa4-11fc3cd7d677)


Taking out common words and words that come up a lot with a stop word tool lets us really get into the text data. This way, we can spot important ideas and themes that aren't as clear because they're hidden by words that show up all the time. Like, if we don't include words such as "vase" or "statue," we might see a stronger emphasis on certain times in history or special ways of making art.

By examining the data on when artworks were added to the collection and looking at the timeline graphs in the notebook, we could spot patterns in how often works from these cultures were captured, especially when looking at the accession year which does not mean when the piece was made. Such patterns might tell us how the museum's interest in different cultures has shifted over the years. For instance, if there's been an increase in collecting Japanese art lately, it might mean there's more interest in Asian cultures among scholars and the general public in the US. Or, it might indicate that during the time where more Japanese objects were found, it was most likely after World War Two, where Japan has become one of the powerful nations.

# Final Thoughts:

Through my examination of the [HAM website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), and looking at the spreadsheets and the notebooks we've been given, I was clearly able to see a pattern of the what cultures hold more significance than others in the Harvard Art Musuem. This project also give me more insight into how meta data and data scraping can give us a lot of information about a given culture, which I never thought this much can be done with this metadata. Overall, I am happy to have learned some new information about given cultures, and to have used that information and its data to format it into wordclouds.
