 **Part one**:
 Among scrolling through the numerous art pieces found in the [Harvard Art Muesuem website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), I was intrigued by the number of art pieces taken from many regions of the world. Among the many, my favorite was the  [Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina](https://hvrd.art/o/70419). This art work, according to the metadata obtained from  the website, is an Italian painiting by Giovanni Battista Piranesi that dates back to the 18th century. What staggered me in this artworks is the beauty and the symbolization of all the elements.It has numerous elements which all symbolize different things.  It connects nature with feilds like Engineering, Architecture, history, etc. And it makes sense. "Via Appia" translates to the " Queen of Roads," which I think stands for the start of modernization of the Roman Empire. The website didn't have any description of the painting and what it symbolizes, which I thought it should contain. However, I found the website easy to use, and you can also get permanent links to the artwork, in addition to being able to download them. In other words, it was pretty accessible. However, with the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), I was able to get a more clear description, and the layout of the objects were filtered based on the year and origin, which made it easier to track. I found the data spreadsheet more convenient to use.

> There were other artworkds i found interesting, such as the[Nocture:Furnace](https://hvrd.art/o/303703), which from what I can see may represent the contrats between light and dark and the endurance through darkness. As from the two artworks i've chosen, you can clearly see that I like pieces with deep meanings. And I found this artpiece reflective of our life and all the challenges we face and how this darkness can also find light.

>**Part two**: Looking at the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), I can see that the musuem contains a wide range of artworks from various cultures, old and contemporary. It even includes past cultures that have different labels than to what they have today. Also using the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001),for example, for the Mongolian culture based on the [HAM](https://harvardartmuseums.org/) website, the most viewed piece is the [1963.5: Standing Bodhisattva Maitreya sculpture](
