 **Part one**:
 Among scrolling through the numerous art pieces found in the [Harvard Art Muesuem website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/), I was intrigued by the number of art pieces taken from many regions of the world. Among the many, my favorite was the  [Ancient intersection of the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina](https://hvrd.art/o/70419). This art work, according to the metadata obtained from  the website, is an Italian painiting by Giovanni Battista Piranesi that dates back to the 18th century. What staggered me in this artworks is the beauty and the symbolization of all the elements.It has numerous elements which all symbolize different things.  It connects nature with fields like Engineering, Architecture, history, etc. And it makes sense. "Via Appia" translates to the " Queen of Roads," which I think stands for the start of modernization of the Roman Empire. The website didn't have any description of the painting and what it symbolizes, which I thought it should contain. However, I found the website easy to use, and you can also get permanent links to the artwork, in addition to being able to download them. In other words, it was pretty accessible. However, with the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), I was able to get a more clear description, and the layout of the objects were filtered based on the year and origin, which made it easier to track. I found the data spreadsheet more convenient to use.

 There were other art works I found interesting, such as the [Nocture:Furnace](https://hvrd.art/o/303703), Another one is the [M2783: Interior](https://hvrd.art/o/263278). Both of these artworks, based on what was said on the website used the technique of etching, which I really find so interesting. I feel like it conveys meaning to the artworks. I usually search for artworks that hold deep meanings, and the ones that have a connection of our lives. The Nocture:Furnace  shows the contrast between light and dark, and how light can find its way through darkness and the second one depics what goes on in the interior of people's lives.. But overall, I found it a bit hard to search for artworks in the [HAM](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections) website just because there were a lot of art pieces and they was no filter.

**Part two**: Looking at the [All_culture_information.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifG8CjQhyKfzgUR3Bqb-vYTGf-kCpmuE-DF8InudGiM/edit#gid=26760480), I can see that the musuem contains a wide range of artworks from various cultures, old and contemporary. It even includes past cultures that have different labels than to what they have today. Also using the [allobjectsdata.cvc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10t7_3_WviFuQNlopr1eHFojPpB89ce1Lb4Dm-GDuUXo/edit#gid=1168201001), we can see that the most viewed artworks are American, British, German, Italian and French. There was a good number of Japanese and Chinese pieces, but I didn't really see many Central Asian or South Asian artworks, and a very little amount of the Middle Easteern pieces.
