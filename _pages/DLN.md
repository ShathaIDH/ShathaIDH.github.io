title: "# Digital Literacy Narrative Reflection: "
---



As a freshman who's planning to potentially major in CS and minor in Interactive Media, I was drawn upon joining this course. When I read the course description, I liked that this course wasn't just designed for those who have high technical knowledge, and as an undecided student, I wanted to discover different areas, which I saw from this course. Our majors spanned a wide spectrum of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. The first thing I got to discover was navigating through Github. At first, I thought it would be difficult to use this tool. But I soon discovered that it was quite easy.

> For example, this is the pages folder responsible for the top border of the website. This was the very first thing I did, using the existing Jeykell template and creating this page that you are currently at.

## Existent Tools
There are many tools that each of us brought to this course, with everyone having their own literacy toolkit. For example, some people are already well informed in python, or other coding tools, others in digital desgining, art, or any other tool. Together, every single person came in with their different experiences and ideas which all became central in this course. In this class, each student brought a distinct set of digital skills that reflected their major. Interactive Media majors demonstrated a good understanding for crafting designs linked to user experience and creating engaging narratives, with Adobe Creative Suite being a major tool that the've used. Students in  Film and New Media were good at producing content and developing stories tailored for the digital realm. Those studying Environmental Studies, for example, understood how to play with data analysis. Business  majors refined their expertise in data analytics platforms, for example, they understood how to use Google sheets and Google excel better. Meanwhile, Literature and Creative Writing students navigated through research databases, such as Project Gutenberg, gathering insights in terms of how literature and text can be transformed in different ways, such as creating wordclouds based on the context of the test, all of which was so interesting to see, coming from a single piece of text. These diverse digital proficiencies intersected within the digital humanities, enriching our collective understanding of how technology influences and enhances our academic and creative expressions.


Among the first things I learned in this course is using notebooks. Well, to be honest, at first, I had not a single clue what these notebooks were for. But, eventually, they turned out to be pretty useful. These notebooks were accessed from Posit Cloud.

> As you can see here, there are a numerous of digital notbooks, each designed to do different things. Most of them use python as their language. The ones we used are the [Cultural Heritage by the numbers notebook]( https://posit.cloud/spaces/332546/content/7584420) and the [ All_Objects notebbok](https://posit.cloud/spaces/332546/content/7584420) which generated wordclouds and bar charts based on the metadata that we provided for each object and culture.

The digital humanities class has highlighted how our different areas of study overlap in the modern digital space. The process of creating content, previously limited to certain disciplines, has become an collaborative effort. We have delved into making engaging websites, constructing digital art, creating detailed narratives, and designing AI-assisted content. This teamwork has underscored the benefits of combining various fields, effectively mixing elements of art, science, and storytelling.

We've also looked into insight of how, for example, AI is used and how it should be used. In the " Hardfork, Generative AI is here : who should control it? podcast, the podcast covered how Emad Mostaque, the CEO of Stability, talks about generative AI, and how it can be used for creativity. But, at the same time, highlights the implications to which it can be used. Things like the ethics of AI was among the subject of the podcast, and how AI shouldn't be abused by high tech companies for purposes that do not support creativity. I found this to be interesting, especially when we talk about AI. I mean, who here doesn't use CHATGPT? At the same time, we discovered how AI is used in digital humanities from generatng text to transforming text into images. These, I think are interesting points that open the area to disover more insightful things on how AI can be utilized in the arts and humanities. 


Another thing was the use of these digital tools to understand a specific culture. For example, in the "Philosophy of the Sufi Impact on the Features of Design," by Professor Dr. Eman Mohamed Anees and Dr. Sanagik Ibrahim Mustafa,The text examines the role of Sufism in shaping art and design over time. It shows how the spiritual and intangible aspects of Sufism have been a source of inspiration, leading to the creation of art and design movements that reflect its values of deep spirituality and detachment from materialism. We also saw how Religion and culture influences Sufism parts of geometry and code.

Our engagement in the digital humanities course heralded a transformative approach to interaction and collaboration. Through digital platforms such as Google Space and online forums, we facilitated an exchange of ideas, fostering rich dialogues that transcended disciplinary boundaries. This collaborative environment was not merely a space for conversation but served as a crucible for applying sophisticated methodologies such as textual analysis, geographic data interpretation, and spatial analysis to our scholarly projects. Digital tools, including Project Gutenberg, Zipler.gl, and voyant tools were useful in helping us transcend between the diffeent ways we can use them in the arts and humanities.

The curriculum encouraged us to embrace computational thinking, a skill set that proved indispensable in an increasingly AI-centric landscape. This proficiency in data analysis, algorithmic logic, and interpretive skills became important among us, irrespective of our primary fields of study. As we navigate the advancing terrain of artificial intelligence, these competencies equip us to leverage AI for innovation and ethical decision-making.

Our exploration extended into the ethical considerations surrounding AI application within our respective domains. Students specializing in Computer Science contemplated the ethical obligations associated with AI development. In contrast, peers in Literature and Creative Writing examined the impact of AI on the narrative process. Meanwhile, Environmental Studies and Business and Marketing students explored AI's utility in environmental monitoring and market trend analysis, respectively.

As we look to the future, we anticipate further cultivating an interdisciplinary approach to education, recognizing its pivotal role in a digitally interconnected world. We envisage a collaborative ecosystem where the integration of arts, sciences, and technology not only fosters innovation but also expands the horizons of our collective knowledge.

In summary, our journey through the digital humanities has been nothing short of revolutionary. It has broadened our intellectual vistas, merging technology with the humanities, and endowed us with a comprehensive suite of digital literacy skills. As we forge ahead into the digital epoch, we are well-prepared for the interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical stewardship that will define our engagement with the digital and AI-enhanced landscape.
